&Message=<font size="0"><b>BIOGRAPHY</b></font><br /><font size="0">Lisa Goodman grew up in Detroit and knew from a very early age she needed to leave. After trying to run away from home by setting off on foo<font size="0">t toward the Jewish community Center, she gave up for several years and instead attended the University of Michigan, but finally found her way to New York City. Once there she made an exhaustive search for an acting teacher and was thrilled to soak up the wisdom of Uta Hagen, William Esper, Michael Howard, Terry Schreiber, and the gr</font>eat voice teachers Marjorie Phillips, and Clive Vinson. In the midst of all these classes she appeared in as The Twirler in Talking With, by Jane Martin at the Actors Theatre of Louisville, and subsequently at Manhattan Theatre Club. She then discovered the thrill of being part of a new play from its beginnings at the American Place Theatre, Ensemble Studio Theatre, Jewish Rep, and several others. She also loved working with the Riverside Shakespeare Company on Othello, the Merry Wives of Windsor, and Measure for Measure,and with the renouned British director Vivian Matalon, on classical texts as well as original plays.</font>
