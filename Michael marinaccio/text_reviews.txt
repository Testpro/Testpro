<div>&ldquo;An oddly circumspect play One Man&rsquo;s War is superbly directed, but the real reason to go is Michael Marinaccio&rsquo;s performance.&rdquo;</div>                     
<div><br /></div>               
<div>&ldquo;Marinaccio endows Doug with great strength of character and we identify with him even though he is a hood. The performance is bold and riveting as we enter this young man&rsquo;s thoughts about war&mdash;from his initial enthusiasm through the experience of scorn upon his return home.&rdquo;</div>

<div>&ldquo;As Doug, Mike Marinaccio turns in a blistering performance of remarkable depth. Marinaccio is also the show&rsquo;s narrator, and as such he holds the play together by connecting its pieces and creating a rich bond with his fellow actors.&rdquo;</div>
